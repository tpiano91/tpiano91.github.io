<h2>Tristan Savella: Data Analyst, Instructor and Award Winning Pianist with a Doctorate in Classical Music Performance</h2>

<p> Having recently, completed the Data Analytics Course by CareerFoundry, as well as the specialization course, Data Visualizations with Python. Before becoming a dedicated and detail-oriented analyst, 
  I trained as a classical pianist for nearly three decades, having studied at some of Europe and North America's most renowned music conservatories. It was while writing my doctoral dissertation 
  (which focused on how to effectively teach young pianists to become skilled collaborative and chamber musicians) that I first discovered data analytics. I became fascinated with the potential impact of data
  and also realized that many of the skills I developed as a musician, pedagogue, academic, competition adjudicator and freelance professional are directly applicable to the work of a data analyst. 
  I look forward being able to using these skills, and developing new ones, in my new role as an analyst. I am currrently seeking a position as a Data/BI Analyst or 
  Visualization Specialist. I am available for full-time or part-time work in Toronto or remote work (I am eligible to work both in Canada and the USA). </p>
  
 <p> Throughout most of my training, I practiced a minimum of four hours a day (up to 7-8 hours a day during busier periods) in order to prepare for my lessons, performances, and prestigious international 
   competitions (in which I frequently participated). The hours in the practice room required
  both a high degree of patience (in the repetition of seemingly menial tasks and drills), discipline and creativity (in terms of finding solutions to technical problems, and developing my own
  personal interpretation of some of the most challenging repertoire). As a teacher, I have developed my communication and organizational skills. I have helped many
  students prepare for various competitions and exams - a process that can take months or years - for which achievable, "bite-size" goals needed to be set on a weekly basis in between 
  each lesson, in preparation for the larger goal. My goals and expectations for each student were recorded in weekly lesson notes, and were also regularl communicated
  to the students' parents (and when teaching in music schools, to my supervisors). My communication and organizational skills were further developed both in my work as a freelance
  collaborative pianist, as well as when writing my doctoral dissertation - a process that took three years, during which I had to regularly report the progress of my thesis to 
  a very busy supervisor. Each email I sent to my supervisor included a detailed timeline of the progress of my thesis, and where I expected to be in the coming months. </p>
   
<p>In addition to classical music, my many other interests include: jazz, tennis, soccer, urban infrastructure & transportation, languages & culture, and traveling. 
  Through my various interests, I became further fascinated with how data can be leveraged in different fields. As a lifelong tennis fan (and competitive player in my youth), 
  I was impressed with the different statistics that are presented on televised matches (such as the revolutions per minute on Rafael Nadal's heavy topspin forehands). 
  When watching videos about urban infrastructure and transportation, I was amazed at how the content creators presented and visualized their data to help their audiences understand 
  what makes certain cities so walkable and livable, and why certain transit systems are more successful than others.
  Finally, as a long-time student and piano teacher, I can imagine a plethora of ways data analysis can be used in music pedagogy, both in research and in practice.
