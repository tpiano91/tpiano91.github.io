<h2>Tristan Savella: Data Analyst, Instructor and Award Winning Classical Pianist</h2>

<p> Before becoming a data analyst, I dedicated nearly three decades to classical piano, studying at prestigious conservatories in Europe and North America. 
  My journey as a performer, teacher, freelance collaborative pianist, and academic led me to discover data analytics while writing my doctoral dissertation. While reading other dissertations 
  by previous doctoral candidates, I was captivated by how data shapes research and realized that the skills I honed as a musician — discipline, creativity, patience, organization and 
  communication — are directly applicable to analytics. Having completed the Data Analytics Course by CareerFoundry, and a specialization course in Data Visualizations with Python, 
  I’m now seeking a role as a Data/BI Analyst or Visualization Specialist. I’m available for full-time or part-time work in Toronto or remotely (eligible to work in Canada and the USA).</p>
  
 <p> My classical music training instilled in me discipline, patience, and creativity, essential for mastering complex techniques and interpreting music.
   These qualities translate directly to data analytics, where tools like SQL, Python, and Tableau are used to tell a story. 
   My experience as a teacher and collaborative pianist honed my communication and organizational skills, critical for managing multiple clients and projects. 
   Lastly, desigining the project for my dissertation on collaborative piano pedagogy further sharpened my ability to handle large-scale tasks, breaking them into manageable pieces and consistently meeting deadlines.

<p>Beyond music, my interests in jazz, tennis, soccer, urban infrastructure, and languages have deepened my understanding of data’s role across fields. 
  As a tennis fan, I’m fascinated by modern statistics like RPM on Rafael Nadal's heavy topspin forehands. 
  While living in Austria for three years, I enjoyed the ease of traveling to different countries by train.
  This further sparked my love of traveling and led me to explore videos on urban infrastructure and transportation systems. 
  In these videos, I admired how data visualization can illustrate what makes cities walkable and transit systems efficient.
