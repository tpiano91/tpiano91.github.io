<h2>Tristan Savella: Data Analyst, Instructor and Award Winning Pianist with a Doctorate in Classical Music Performance</h2>

<p> Before becoming a dedicated and detail-oriented analyst, I trained as a classical pianist for nearly three decades, having studied at some of Europe and North America's most renowned music conservatories. 
  I have extensive experience as a performer, private music teacher (piano and music theory), freelance collaborative pianist, and competition adjudicator. I first discovered data analytics
  while writing my doctoral dissertation. I became fascinated with the potential impact of data when reading dissertations by previous doctoral candidates, how each of their projects were designed,
  and the various methods of collecting, using and interpreting their data to support their arguments. I then realized that many of the skills I developed as a musician, pedagogue, academic, adjudicator 
  and freelance professional are directly applicable to the work of a data analyst. I look forward being able to using these skills (and developing new skills) as an analyst. Having recently completed 
  the Data Analytics Course by CareerFoundry Data Visualizations with Python, I am currrently seeking a position as a Data/BI Analyst or 
  Visualization Specialist. I am available for full-time or part-time work in Toronto, or remote work (I am eligible to work both in Canada and the USA). </p>
  
 <p> Through my classical music training, I developed a high level of discipline and patience from a young age. I was required to practice
   4-6 hours daily in order to prepare for my lessons and performances, as well as to develop a reliable technical foundation.
   The hours in the practice room also required creativity and curiosity, especially in developing my own personal interpretation of each piece.
   While completing my Data Analytics courses with CareerFoundry, I found similarities between the work of a data analyst and a musician. When learning and mastering the different technical tools (such as SQL, Python and Tableau), 
   it was important to remind myself that the use of these tools are subservient to the presentation of data, similar to how the purpose of achieving a high-level piano technique is strictly for a pianist 
   to be able to execute their interpretations exactly as they want. In both cases, the "message" or "story" is more important than the technical skills.</p>
  
  <p>As a working musician, I further developed my communication and organizational skills. Teaching required breaking down students' long-term goals (such as piano competitions or exams) 
    into weekly "bite-size" goals in between each lesson. These goals and expectations were recorded in weekly lesson notes, and were also regularly communicated to the students' parents. 
    As a freelance collaborative pianist, organization was key to managing multiple clients at once (for scheduling rehearsals, keeping track of performance dates, and organizing a practice schedule
    to prepare for these dates). Communication skills were important when rehearsing with these clients, and my style of communication
    depended on the client: with "high-level" clients (such as other professional musicians), 
    many discussions were needed to ensure that I played my part exactly as they wanted. For younger clients, I often took on the role of a coach.
    When writing my dissertation, a large-scale independent project that took three years, I had to break down large goals into smaller tasks and regularly report my progress to 
    a very busy supervisor (who supervised dozens of doctoral theses at any given moment). Each email to my supervisor included a detailed timeline of upcoming deadlines that I set for myself.

<p>In addition to classical music, my many other interests include: jazz, tennis, soccer, urban infrastructure & transportation, languages & culture, and traveling.
  Through my various interests, I became aware of how data can be leveraged in different fields. As a lifelong tennis fan (and competitive player in my youth), 
  I was impressed with the different statistics that are presented on televised matches (such as the revolutions per minute on Rafael Nadal's heavy topspin forehands). 
  While pursuing my Masters Degree in Austria, I enjoyed the ease of traveling to different countries by train, further sparking my love of traveling and interest in transportation systems.
  This prompted me to start watching videos about urban infrastructure and transit sytems, during which I enjoyed how the content creators presented and visualized their data to help their audiences understand 
  what makes certain cities so walkable and livable, why certain city/national transit systems are more successful than others, and the intricacies of train schedules/connectivity.
