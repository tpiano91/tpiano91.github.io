<h2>Tristan Savella: Data Analyst, Instructor and Award Winning Pianist with a Doctorate in Classical Music Performance</h2>

<p> Before becoming a dedicated and detail-oriented analyst, I trained as a classical pianist for nearly three decades, having studied at some of Europe and North America's most renowned music conservatories. 
  I have extensive experience as a performer, private music teacher (piano and music theory), freelance collaborative pianist, and competition adjudicator It was while writing my doctoral dissertation 
  (which focused on how to effectively teach young pianists to become skilled collaborative and chamber musicians) that I first discovered data analytics. I became 
  fascinated with the potential impact of data when reading dissertations by previous doctoral candidates and other documents - particularly interesting to me were the way each of the experiments were designed 
  and the various methods of collecting, using and interpreting their data to support their arguments. I then realized that many of the skills I developed as a musician, pedagogue, academic, adjudicator 
  and freelance professional are directly applicable to the work of a data analyst. I look forward being able to using these skills, and developing new ones, in my new role as an analyst. Having recently completed 
  the Data Analytics Course by CareerFoundry Data Visualizations with Python, I am currrently seeking a position as a Data/BI Analyst or 
  Visualization Specialist. I am available for full-time or part-time work in Toronto, or remote work (I am eligible to work both in Canada and the USA). </p>
  
 <p> Throughout my classical music training and work experience, I developed many of the overlapping skills required of a data analyst. From a young age, I developed a high level of discipline and patience, practicing 
   a minimum of four hours a day (up to 7-8 hours a day during busier periods) in order to prepare for my lessons, performances, and prestigious international competitions (in which I frequently participated), as well as
   to develop a reliable technical foundation (which was particularly important in my earlier training years). In addition to discipline and patience,
   the hours in the practice room also required creativity and curiosity, in terms of finding solutions to technical problems, and developing my own personal interpretation of some of the most challenging piano repertoire. 
   While completing my Data Analytics courses with CareerFoundry, I found similarities between the work of a data analyst and a musician. When learning and mastering the different technical tools (such as SQL, Python and Tableau), 
   it was important to remind myself that the use and capabilities of these tools should only subservient to the presentation of data, similar to how the purpose of achieving a high-level piano technique is strictly for a pianist 
   to be able to execute their interpretations exactly as they want - in both cases, the "message" or "story" is far more important than the technique (be it piano technique, or technical tools for data analytics). (Having said this,
   I still enjoyed exploring "technique for technique's sake", be it learning all the different things python can do, or mastering a particularly difficult piano technique)</p>
  
  <p>As a working musician, I further developed my communication and organizational skills. As a teacher, I prepared many students for various competitions and exams - 
    a process that can take months or years. For long-term goals, "bite-size" goals needed to be set on a weekly basis in between 
    each lesson, in preparation for the larger goal. My goals and expectations for each student were recorded in weekly lesson notes, and were also regularly communicated
    to the students' parents (and when teaching as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Toronto, to my supervisors). Both skills are also essential to my work as a
    freelance collaborative pianist: organization was key to keeping track of multiple clients at once (each preparing for their own performances), organizing a practice and
    rehearsal schedule, managing large volumes of repertoire to learn, and ensuring that I met all of the different deadlines (in this case, making sure to learn each of the pieces
    in advance of the different performance dates). Communication was key when rehearsing with these clients: with "high-level" clients (such as other professional musicians or 
    music majors preparing for their graduate recitals at their conservatory), many discussions were needed to ensure that I played my part exactly as they wanted. For younger
    clients, coaching them on how to play with a pianist was part of my job.
    These two skills were also important while writing my dissertation - a process that took three years, during which I had to regularly report the progress of my thesis to 
    a very busy supervisor (who supervised dozens of doctoral theses at any given moment). Each email to my supervisor included a detailed timeline of the progress of my thesis, 
    and where I expected to be in the coming months. Through my unique experiences, I can imagine a plethora of ways data analysis can be used in music pedagogy, performance and academia.

<p>In addition to classical music, my many other interests include: jazz, tennis, soccer, urban infrastructure & transportation, languages & culture, and traveling.
  Through my various interests, I became aware of how data can be leveraged in different fields. As a lifelong tennis fan (and competitive player in my youth), 
  I was impressed with the different statistics that are presented on televised matches (such as the revolutions per minute on Rafael Nadal's heavy topspin forehands). 
  While pursuing my Masters Degree in Austria, I enjoyed the ease of traveling to different countries by train, further sparking my love of traveling and interest in transportation systems.
  This prompted me to start watching videos about urban infrastructure and transit sytems, during which I enjoyed how the content creators presented and visualized their data to help their audiences understand 
  what makes certain cities so walkable and livable, why certain city/national transit systems are more successful than others, and the intricacies of train schedules/connectivity.
