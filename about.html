<h2>Tristan Savella: Data Analyst, Instructor and Award Winning Pianist with a Doctorate in Classical Music Performance</h2>

<p> Before becoming a data analyst, I dedicated nearly three decades to classical piano, studying at prestigious conservatories in Europe and North America. 
  My journey as a performer, teacher, freelance collaborative pianist, and academic led me to discover data analytics while writing my doctoral dissertation. While reading other dissertations 
  by previous doctoral candidates, I was captivated by how data shapes research and realized that the skills I honed as a musician — discipline, creativity, patience, organization and 
  communication — are directly applicable to analytics. Having completed the Data Analytics Course by CareerFoundry, and a specialization course in Data Visualizations with Python, 
  I’m now seeking a role as a Data/BI Analyst or Visualization Specialist. I’m available for full-time or part-time work in Toronto or remotely (eligible to work in Canada and the USA).</p>
  
 <p> In my classical music training, discipline and patience were essential and were developed from a young age. Daily practice, often 4-6 hours, required not just technical mastery but also creativity in interpreting pieces. 
     Similarly, in data analytics, tools like SQL, Python, and Tableau serve the story behind the data, just as technique serves a pianist’s interpretation. As a working musician, 
     I developed strong communication and organizational skills. Teaching involved breaking down long-term goals into manageable weekly tasks and communicating progress to students' parents
     or to a supervisor. As a collaborative pianist, I juggled multiple clients, requiring me to manage a busy rehearsal/practice schedule and to keep track of various deadlines (in the form of performance dates). My style of communication
      depended on the client: with "high-level" clients (such as other professional musicians), many discussions were needed to ensure that I played my part exactly as they wanted. 
      For younger clients, I often took on the role of a coach.
      Lastly, writing my dissertation further strengthened my ability to manage large projects, breaking them into smaller tasks and regularly reporting progress to
      a very busy supervisor (who supervised dozens of doctoral theses at any given moment). Each email to my supervisor included a detailed timeline of upcoming deadlines that I set for myself.

<p>In addition to classical music, my diverse interests — jazz, tennis, soccer, urban infrastructure, transportation systems, languages, culture and travel — 
  have deepened my appreciation for data’s role across fields.  As a lifelong tennis fan (and competitive player in my youth), 
  I was impressed with the different statistics that are presented on televised matches (such as the revolutions per minute on Rafael Nadal's heavy topspin forehands). 
  While pursuing my Masters Degree in Austria, I enjoyed the ease of traveling to different countries by train, further sparking my love of traveling and interest in transportation systems.
  This prompted me to start watching videos about urban infrastructure and transit sytems, during which I enjoyed how the content creators presented and visualized their data to help their audiences understand 
  what makes certain cities so walkable and livable, why certain city/national transit systems are more successful than others, and the intricacies of train schedules/connectivity.
