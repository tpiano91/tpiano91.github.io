<h2>Welcome to Tristan Savella's Portfolio</h2>
<p>I am an American data analyst based in Toronto, Canada with a doctorate in Classical Music Performance from the University of Toronto. 
    Please see my "Case Studies" page to view two of my recent projects: "Instacart: Marketing Strategy for an Online Grocery Store" and "Launch Strategy for an Online Video Rental Company".
    On this homepage, you will also find links to the GitHub repository and ReadMe files for these two projects and three additional projects, providing more detailed information of my analytical process and techniques used.
