<p>With a doctorate in classical music performance and over a decade of experience as a teacher and freelance professional, I am now seeking to transition into a data analyst role. 
In 2024, I completed the Data Analytics Course at CareerFoundry, including a specialization course in Data Visualizations with Python. 
My journey revealed significant overlap between the technical demands of data analysis my existing skill set - including attention to detail, curiosity, analytical thinking, communication and organization. 
I am eager to continue honing these skills in a new analyst role, available for for work in Toronto, or remote work.</p>

<p>
My portfolio currently contains three case studies: "Instacart: Marketing Strategy for an Online Grocery Store", "Launch Strategy for an Online Video Rental Company" and "ATP Tennis: The Importance of Serve Statistics".
On this homepage, you will also find links to the GitHub repository and ReadMe files for these three projects and two additional projects, providing more detailed information of my analytical process and techniques used.
Thank you for visiting!</p>
