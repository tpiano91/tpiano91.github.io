<p>I am a data analyst with a background as a classical pianist and teacher. After receiving my doctorate in performance from the University of Toronto, 
I began the Data Analytics Course from CareerFoundry (including a specialization course on Data Visualizations with Python). While learning the skillset of a data analyst
(through various projects using tools like Python, Excel, Tableau and SQL), I realized many of the skills overlapped with my unique background. These skills include: curiosity, patience, diligence, communication, teaching and organization. </p>

<p>
Please see my "Case Studies" page to view three of my recent projects: "Instacart: Marketing Strategy for an Online Grocery Store", "Launch Strategy for an Online Video Rental Company" and "ATP Tennis: The Importance of Serve Statistics".
On this homepage, you will also find links to the GitHub repository and ReadMe files for these three projects and two additional projects, providing more detailed information of my analytical process and techniques used.
Thank you for visiting!</p>
