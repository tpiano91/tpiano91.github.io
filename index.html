    <p>Welcome - I'm Tristan and I'm a data analyst. I am also a freelance classical musician with a doctorate in performance and over a decade of experience as a teacher/collaborative pianist.
    In 2024, I completed the Data Analytics Course at CareerFoundry, including a specialization course in Data Visualizations with Python. 
    My journey revealed significant overlap between the technical demands of data analysis and my existing skill set - including attention to detail, curiosity, analytical thinking, communication, and organization. 
    I am eager to continue honing these skills and developing new skills in my new position.</p>
