<p>I am an American analyst based in Toronto, with a background as a classical pianist, teacher and freelance professional.
In 2023, I began the Data Analytics Course from CareerFoundry (including a specialization course on Data Visualizations with Python). 
While learning the technical skills of a data analyst (through tools like Python, Excel, Tableau and SQL), I realized many of the other required skills overlapped with my unique background. 
I look forward to further developing these skills, and learning new ones, in my new role as an analyst. 
Iâ€™m now seeking a role as a Data/BI Analyst or Visualization Specialist. I am available for full-time or part-time work in Toronto or remotely (eligible to work in Canada and the USA).</p>

<p>
My portfolio currently contains three case studies: "Instacart: Marketing Strategy for an Online Grocery Store", "Launch Strategy for an Online Video Rental Company" and "ATP Tennis: The Importance of Serve Statistics".
On this homepage, you will also find links to the GitHub repository and ReadMe files for these three projects and two additional projects, providing more detailed information of my analytical process and techniques used.
Thank you for visiting!</p>
