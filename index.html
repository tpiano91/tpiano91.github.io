<p> Welcome - I'm Tristan and I'm a data analyst. I am also a freelance classical musician with a doctorate in performance and over a decade of experience as a teacher/collaborative pianist.
In 2024, I completed the Data Analytics Course at CareerFoundry, including a specialization course in Data Visualizations with Python. 
My journey revealed significant overlap between the technical demands of data analysis and my existing skill set - including attention to detail, curiosity, analytical thinking, communication and organization. 
I am eager to continue honing these skills and developing new skills in my new position.</p>

<p>
My portfolio currently contains three case studies: "Instacart: Marketing Strategy for an Online Grocery Store", "Launch Strategy for an Online Video Rental Company" and "ATP Tennis: The Importance of Serve Statistics".
On this homepage, you will also find links to the GitHub repository and ReadMe files for these three projects and two additional projects, providing more detailed information of my analytical process and techniques used.
Thank you for visiting!</p>
